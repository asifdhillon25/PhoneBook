# Phonebook Record Management System

üìû This project is a simple phonebook record management system implemented in C++. It allows users to manage contacts by performing various operations such as adding new contacts and displaying all existing contacts. The program reads contact information from a text file, performs operations based on user input, and stores the modified data back to the text file.

## Features
- **Add Contact:** Users can add new contacts to the phonebook.
- **Show All Contacts:** Users can display all existing contacts stored in the phonebook.
- **Persistent Storage:** Contact information is stored in a text file, ensuring data persistence across sessions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The program provides a simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation and interaction.

## Usage
To use the phonebook record management system:
1. üîÑ Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. üõ†Ô∏è Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the compiled executable to launch the program.
4. üìã Follow the on-screen instructions to perform desired operations.

## Technologies Used
- C++ programming language
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- File I/O operations
- Object-oriented programming principles

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional functionalities such as editing and deleting contacts.
- Improve error handling and input validation.
- Enhance the user interface for a more polished experience.
